 # 🎯 Number Guessing Game

Hey! This is one of the first Python projects I built as I’m learning how to code. It’s a simple terminal game where the computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100, and you try to guess it.

Each time you guess, the program will let you know if you’re too high or too low — and it keeps track of how many tries you needed to get it right.

## 🧠 Why I Made This

I'm just getting started with programming, and I wanted something fun and hands-on to help me understand:
- How loops work
- How to get input from a user
- Using random numbers
- Basic error handling in Python

It’s simple — but it helped me learn a lot.

## ▶️ How to Run It

Make sure you have Python installed. Then in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
